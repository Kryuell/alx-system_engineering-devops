# 0x04. Loops, Conditions, and Parsing

## Overview

Welcome to the 0x04 project on loops, conditions, and parsing! In this project, we'll learn about some fundamental concepts in computer programming that help us control the flow of our code and handle data effectively.

## Directory Structure

- **0-RSA_public_key.pub:** This file contains the RSA public key generated as part of a task.
- **other_files:** This directory contains additional files related to various tasks.
- **scripts:** This directory contains scripts written to solve specific problems or automate tasks.

## What to Expect

Throughout this project, we'll cover the following topics:

- **Loops:** Loops help us repeat tasks multiple times without writing the same code over and over again.
- **Conditions:** Conditions allow us to make decisions in our code based on certain criteria.
- **Parsing:** Parsing involves analyzing and extracting specific information from text or data.
